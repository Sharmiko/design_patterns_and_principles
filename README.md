# Design Patterns and Principles


## Principles:
1. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

## Design Patterns: 

### Creational Patterns
1) [Factory Method](./factory_method) - Define an interface for creating an object, but let the subclasses decide what class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
2) [Abstract Factory](./abstract_factory) - Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying concrete classes.
3) [Builder](./builder) - Separate the construction of a complex object
from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
4) [Prototype](./prototype) - Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
5) [Singleton](./singleton) - Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

### Structural Patterns
1) [Adapter](./adapter) - Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
2) [Bridge](./bridge) - Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
3) [Composite](./composite) - Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. 
4) [Decorator](./decorator) - Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
5) [Facade](./facade) - Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
6) Flyweight - TODO
7) Proxy - TODO

### Behavioral Patterns:
1) Chain of Responsibility - TODO
2) Command - TODO
3) Iterator - TODO
4) Mediator - TODO
5) Memento - TODO
6) [Observer](./observer_pattern)
7) State - TODO
8) Strategy - TODO
9) Template Method - TODO
10) Visitor - TODO
